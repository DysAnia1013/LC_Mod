## What is Diversity?
Diversity is a mod that revamps few aspects of the game. Generally the entities itself.

## What changed?
This is what Diversity revamps:
- Spiders
- Crawlers
- Bracken
- Centipede
- Dress girl
- The players

## The Spiders & Crawlers
- Added brief slow with a few seconds cooldown to the Spiders and Crawlers when hitting them. (This was added to balance the rail cheese fix.)

## The Bracken
- The Bracken will now stay true to his darkness. He will flicker and turn off all nearby lights and will dim player's flashlights if they're close to the Bracken.
- The lights turned off by the Bracken will naturally turn back on after a minute or 2.
- Trying to forcibly turn back on the lights with the breaker box could cause the Bracken to be angered for a while and shut off all power permanently.

## The Dress girl
- She will haunt your walkie-talkie.

## The Centipedes
- You can now help your friends out whenever a centipede is latched onto their head by spamming the use button if you don't have a shovel.

## The Players
- Players will receive conditions such as broken leg, broken arm and bleeding.

## Config
Mostly anything in this mod is configurable. If there's something you'd like to be able to configure and isn't there, either join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/4APzjc8fNW) or contact me by email (contact@integritychaos.com) and I'll make the changes on the next mod update!
