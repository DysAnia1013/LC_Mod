# Snap Rotate Furniture
No more messing up your furniture rotation! By pressing the item activation key *(Default: LMB or Right Trigger/R2)* you can snap your furniture to the next 45-degree angle to keep it flush against walls or tucked away in corners. If you like the mod, don't forget to give it a thumbs-up!
