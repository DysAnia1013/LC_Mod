# 1.2.3
I seemed to have fixed the experience gain problem with my drops and possible immortal enemies. As I am working on these mods on my personal time sadly I can not do much but I will try. Please if you could donate a 1$ it would motivate me more as I lost my job. Thanks for the support!

# 1.2.2
Sorry about the random items spawning everything in the game. That issue is now fixed.

# 1.2.1
Items can now be randomly dropped if you leave the config line empty and if you put 'NONE' in its place it should drop nothing. If you want to config the random items amount of drops and value you can do the following: RANDOM, 0, 3, 0, 100, 1000. You can config it like any other items but it must use the word RANDOM as the item name.

Hopefully there is no more mass item lag spawns for clients anymore

Tried to address the issue where clients would get huge frame drops from non host items showing up after Masked deaths. Also tried to sync item spawns on clients from host.
